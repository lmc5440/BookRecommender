Eva is a naturally gifted and imaginative storyteller who meets people from all stations and walks of life. Though she has no wealth, she trades her stories like currency with people who are kind to her. In this novel, she shares the story of her own life and introduces readers to a diverse and eccentric cast of characters including the Lebanese émigré who befriends her and takes her in; her unfortunate godmother, whose brain is addled by rum and who believes in all the Catholic saints and a few of her own invention; a street urchin who grows into a petty criminal and, later, a leader in the guerrilla struggle; a celebrated transsexual entertainer who instructs her in the ways of the adult world; and a young refugee whose flight from postwar Europe will prove crucial to Eva's fate.As Eva tells her story, Isabel Allende conjures up a whole complex South American nation—the rich, the poor, the simple, and the sophisticated—in a novel replete with character and incident, with drama and comedy and history, with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions, a novel that celebrates the power of imagination to create a better world.",Bantam,"['El Negro', 'Rolf Carlé', 'Huberto Naranjo', 'Melesio/Mimi', 'Eva Luna', 'Zulema', 'La Señora', 'Consuelo', 'Riad Halabi']",['Chile'],307,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0394751019,The Persian Boy,Mary Renault,10.85,90,302,1497,3301,4102,9292,705,4,5,Truly Amazing (And this is coming from a reluctant reader),"First off I want to say that I was not initially a fan of Bagoas, I have always been much more partial to Hephastion. As this was from Bagoas's point of view I was initially reluctant to read it but I am VERY glad I did. I have come to love Bagoas every bit as much as Hephastion, much like Alexander did. Though of course this isn't a memoir penned by Bagoas himself, I do very much believe that Mary Renault did him justice and he would be proud. He deserves to have his story told just as much as Alexander does. Bagoas wasn't some weak, frightened, limp wristed eunuch by any stretch of the imagination. He not only survived Royal politics, which is in a feat in itself, but he survived the fall of Darius, the xenophobic Macedonians, an assassination attempt and an incredible and harrowing march through India and the desert. Many, many men (who actually did have balls) did not survive that particular campaign. To me, this just proves the point that being a man is less about what you look like physically and more about what you are made of inside. Cheesy sounding I know, but true. I highly, highly recommend this book, not just for Alexander-aphiles, but for anyone simply looking for something good to read - gay or straight.",2009-06-12,"“It takes skill to depict, as Miss Renault has done, this half-man, half Courtesan who is so deeply in love with the warrior.”–The Atlantic MonthlyThe Persian Boy traces the last years of Alexander’s life through the eyes of his lover, Bagoas. Abducted and gelded as a boy, Bagoas was sold as a courtesan to King Darius of Persia, but found freedom with Alexander after the Macedon army conquered his homeland. Their relationship sustains Alexander as he weathers assassination plots, the demands of two foreign wives, a sometimes-mutinous army, and his own ferocious temper. After Alexander’s mysterious death, we are left wondering if this Persian boy understood the great warrior and his ambitions better than anyone.",Vintage,"['Darius III', 'Roxana of Bactria', 'Hephaestion', 'Alexander the Great', 'Bagoas']","['Persia', 'Persian Empire']",420,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

0375705856,Plainsong,Kent Haruf,10.2,977,3056,13632,28727,24678,71070,5984,11,5,Simplicity of Style,"From the age of five when we learn to read, to the age of six when we learn to write, to the age of eight when we learn to write with plots, we know to use quotation marks when someone speaks. ""Yes,"" said the cat.""No,"" said the dog.Moreover, we are taught vocabulary, and encouraged to use ""big words"" in our writing. The lethargic woman opted to reside in her domicile while her vigorous spouse desired to trek throughout the globe. However, Kent Haruf, author of Plainsong follows the message of the title: describing the intricacy of human nature by illustrating its simplicity. He does this by abandoning quotation marks and using vocabulary a fourth-grader could follow. Haruf uses style in order to show the theme of Plainsong, because he shows complexity masked by simplicity.I logged on to amazon.com in order to find out what my fellow readers thought about Haruf's unsophisticated style. October 23, 2000, someone named janmcalex said, ""[Plainsong's] simplicity of style gives the reader the opportunity to emotionally participate in the lives of the characters."" However, I do not think that Haruf's style has to do with emotion; it has more to do with the theme, which is how it is human nature to hold a careful, straightforward faade while deep, complex needs are hurting inside. This faade can even fool the one hiding behind it. Haruf's easygoing writing style masks the complex needs of the characters inside it. True, there is no excess of punctuation or verbiage to get in the way of one's understanding of the characters. Another reviewer, skoneill, wrote, ""... my heart aches for his protagonists..."" I felt this way as well, but I think this simplicity of style is a kind of metaphor for the human ability to seem simple and carefree while unknown intricacies are brewing inside.Later in the review, however, janmcalex touches on the theme. ""Such simple gifts to salve over deep needs."" Simple gifts, in this story, are the influence of other people. Old bachelors, the MacPheron brothers, need the touch of a young lady in their neglected home and graceful teenager Victoria Roubideaux comes to stay with them. Tom Guthrie and his two sons need a mother figure in their lives and then they meet Maggie Jones, a lovable and strong woman. They live in a small town called Holt, where nothing puts it on a map. Even the town they live in seems like what some might call a ""hick town,"" but the relationships of the characters are so complex that as I was reading the book, I forgot the setting was in a place where the population was no more than 5,000 people. By omitting quotation marks that the most elegant of authors would use, Kent Haruf conveys a sense of simplicity in the beginning. I found, though, that I forgot about the simple vocabulary and punctuation; I concentrated on the far-reaching needs of the plausible characters in which everyone can find characteristics of him or herself. Both skoneill and janmcalex agree, saying, ""... [the characters] are human and recognizable archetypes who might well live next door"" and ""...in these misfits, we find elements of ourselves.""On the other hand, a person called rhymeswithorange wrote a review on June 11, 2003, and said, ""While I did enjoy some aspects of the plot, other storylines annoyed and distracted me from my overall satisfaction."" However, I completely disagree. Haruf hid the true intricacy of the plot and characters behind his simplistic style. Perhaps he hid this intention too well for rhymeswithorange. Having multiple storylines shows that even in an uncomplicated town with uncomplicated dialogue, unbelievably complicated things could be happening. rhymeswithorange also stated that, ""Overall, I believe that if Plainsong lacked the storyline of Victoria it would have been much better."" Then again, Victoria's story was the most telling plotline in this book. She acted strong even though she was pregnant, homeless, and unemployed. Maggie Jones healed her needs by giving her a mother figure to look up to and by delivering her to the door of the MacPheron brothers, who seemed like typical old ranchers. On the contrary, as Victoria's story developed, they turn out to be generous, wise, and almost saintly. They give Victoria everything she wants, material to the simplest gift, rebuilding her trust in men, when in the past the men she knew had practically no redeeming qualities.Haruf's simple style puts up its own faade around the intricacy of the characters and plot beyond. It is similar to human nature, the nature of those characters with which we can identify. A reviewer called spencer625 said, ""...I'd like to read it again some day."" I agree, and I cannot wait for what reviewer nashvillebear said on July 31, 2003: ""CBS plans to present Plainsong as a Hallmark Hall of Fame film.""",2003-10-30,"A heartstrong story of family and romance, tribulation and tenacity, set on the High Plains east of Denver.In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether. A teenage girl—her father long since disappeared, her mother unwilling to have her in the house—is pregnant, alone herself, with nowhere to go. And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known.From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.Utterly true to the rhythms and patterns of life, Plainsong is a novel to care about, believe in, and learn from.",Vintage,,"['Holt, Colorado', 'Denver, Colorado', 'Colorado']",301,English,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Reading it from a sociological perspective allowed me to gain even more insights than I would have otherwise. It allowed me to both participate in the reading and the enjoyment of the novel, but also to be able to analyze the broader meanings of what is going on in the book as it relates to sociology. C. Wright Mills thought that people often see their lives as having explanation solely in terms of personal success and failures, failing to see the many ways in which their own personal biographies link with the course of human history. This could be said to be the root of all of Harry Haller's problems.Steppenwolf is the story of Harry Haller, a middle aged intellectual who is unable to find any joy in life. Having taken a course in Sociology, one can see that an individual's choices are never free but are always determined to some extent by a person's environment. This is a core idea in Sociology and may have saved Harry a lot of heartache. He moves into a boarding house, where despairing, lonely, and suicidal, he laments his life and his lack of any feeling of identity with the society around him. Durkheim called the way Harry was feeling, anomie, and felt that it was caused by a lack of integration of the individual into social groups and communities. This feeling of anomie causes people to feel lost or adrift and it is this feeling that causes Harry to feel suicidal.Harry comes to view himself as a Steppenwolf, or a wolf of the steppes, in that he views himself as a man of a dual nature. He yearns to transcend the Normative order of the bourgeoise and into the world of the spiritual, but he also feels drawn to this world of sensual pleasures. Not being able to comprehend how society is able to find happiness in their lives of drab conformity, where people seem to coast along with productive diligence towards meaninglessness, yet unable to resist the charms of their easy sense of happiness, Harry begins to loathe the Steppenwolf he sees himself as. He is unable to come to terms with the concept of Socialization, the ways in which people learn to conform to their society's norms, values, and roles. Fom an interactionist perspective, it can be seen that Harry is having a difficult time with the devolopement of his social self through the interaction with others. Unable to take the role of the generalized other, unable to shape his participation in a social life according to the roles of others, identification becomes a problem for Harry in that he does not wholly identify with any social groups. Half man, half wolf, half desiring the easy and sensual pleasures of the common man, he also desires to transcend this life that, for him, has no value. In a Social Darwinistic manner of speaking, it could be said that Harry has been unable to adapt to the social environment in which he finds himself.One night, while walking through the city, Harry sees a sign over a door thatreads ""MAGIC THEATER--ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY."" Looking closer he notices the words, ""FOR MADMEN ONLY"". Enthralled but unable to open the door, he is given a book by the sign holder entitled, ""Treatise on the Steppenwolf."" Upon reading it, Harry discovers that the book is describing himself, the half man, half wolf that he sees himself as, feeling drawn to more spiritual matters, but unable to altogether resist the sensual pleasures of this mundane world. At this point, Harry becomes even more convinced of his desire for suicide.Before he is able to do so though, and after a disastrous meeting with one of his former colleagues, in which Harry insults him about a picture of Goethe, the German poet, in his house, he ultimately meets the woman that will lead him towards salvation, a young sensual woman named Hermine. She teaches Harry to dance and how to enjoy life's simple pleasures without having to analyze his every feeling. Becoming totally enthralled with her and agreeing to obey her every command, Hermine informs him of his ultimate duty, which will be, after falling in love with her, to kill her.At this point, Harry jumps head first into a life of sensual hedonistic pleasures and he comes to appreciate such a life, based upon the pleasure principle, even though he still feels a sense of yearning for transcendence above such a life. After attending a masquerade dance and dancing with Hermine, Harry is invited by a man named Pablo into his Magic Theater and this is where the book gets even more symbolic and metaphorical. Harry is told that the goal of the theater is to lose his personality and that the only avenue for doing such is laughter. Harry laughs at himself in a mirror and travels down a corridor of doors, some of which he enters, into a sort of theater of the absurd, a kind of waking dream. Entering one room where he finds Hermine and Pablo naked and lying on the floor, he believes that this is the moment that Hermine had meant when she told him that he must ultimately kill her, so, finding a knive magically appear in this pocket he proceeds to stab and kill her. He is now greeted by the ghost of Mozart, the classical composer, who tells Harry that he is much too serious and that he has committed a grave error by misunderstanding the magic theater and that his goal was to learn laughter.Erik Erikson said that throughout the life course, an individual must resolve a series of conflicts that shape that person's sense of self and ability to perform social roles successfully. It is this conflict that we see Harry having a difficult time with. Hermine and Pablo make an attempt at resocialization for Harry, but he ultimately takes everything too seriously and misses the point that laughter is the key to happiness. It can be seen that as society becomes more complex, it tends to become characterized more and more by secondary groups and organizations, making society more efficient but also causing confusion and unhappiness. This is the story of Harry Haller.Using social imagination, I was able to analyze Harry Haller's feelings and actions from a sociological perspective. I was able to see how Harry was having a hard time coping with society, and how that it was this inner turmoil that he labeled the Steppenwolf. I can very much relate to Harry Haller, as I myself have found myself feeling exactly as he has over the years. I, too, have felt a sense of the Steppenwolf within me, a sense of not being able to recognize myself in others and the easy way some people seem able to proceed through life. It has always seemed to me that the vast majority of mankind seems easily able to just live life without having to think about much of anything. For people like myself and Harry Haller, there is a spiritual yearning for more, even as we reject much of what religion has to offer. The story of the Steppenwolf is to realize that there is a dual nature within all of us, even more than just two natures actually, according to Herman Hesse, and that the best remedy is to learn to be able to laugh at life and at ourselves.It is interesting that laughter is also one of the main themes of another book I have just finished, Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. In the Steppenwolf, laughter is what Harry was to learn in order to find some sort of happiness, while in Bradbury's book, it was laughter that was used to thwart the evil carnival freaks. It seems that Harry Haller was visited in his life by Bradbury's carnival freaks and unable to learn laughter, succumbed to their evil.I would definitely recommend this book, especially to those introspective types, such as myself, who may feel a tinge of the Steppenwolf within their own soul. It is my humble opinion that if one is paying attention to the world around them, and not just floating through life Paris Hilton like, then one can't help but to feel their own personal Steppenwolf.",2009-10-18,"Steppenwolf is a poetical self-portrait of a man who felt himself to be half-human and half-wolf. This Faust-like and magical story is evidence of Hesse's searching philosophy and extraordinary sense of humanity as he tells of the humanization of a middle-aged misanthrope. Yet his novel can also be seen as a plea for rigorous self-examination and an indictment of the intellectual hypocrisy of the period.

This prodigious narrative, composed by the poet Ferdowsi between the years 980 and 1010, tells the story of pre- Islamic Iran, beginning in the mythic time of Creation and continuing forward to the Arab invasion in the seventh century. As a window on the world, ""Shahnameh"" belongs in the company of such literary masterpieces as Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" the plays of Shakespeare, the epics of Homer- classics whose reach and range bring whole cultures into view. In its pages are unforgettable moments of national triumph and failure, human courage and cruelty, blissful love and bitter grief.In tracing the roots of Iran, ""Shahnameh"" initially draws on the depths of legend and then carries its story into historical times, when ancient Persia was swept into an expanding Islamic empire. Now Dick Davis, the greatest modern translator of Persian poetry, has revisited that poem, turning the finest stories of Ferdowsi's original into an elegant combination of prose and verse. For the first time in English, in the most complete form possible, readers can experience ""Shahnameh"" in the same way that Iranian storytellers have lovingly conveyed it in Persian for the past thousand years.",Viking,"['Rostam', 'Sohrab', 'Simorgh &...', 'Esfandiar']",,886,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yet the book never whines, it never pushes itself sobbing on your shoulder. It sits in dignity with sadness.Very quietly and methodically tragic, in the Irish way that says you do not whine about tragedy, you do not make fuss of it, you just simply pray a bit and go on. What makes the book so very valuable and unusual is that it applies the Irish knack for storytelling and forthright 'un-tragic' tragedy to women's lives and women's stories.

I just finished reading &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; by the late Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas--and what a challenge it is for me to describe or assess this extraordinary work of fiction. It seems to be a hybrid of memoir, satire, and wild, hallucinatory magical realism. Maybe I should de-emphasize the term &quot;realism.&quot; Historical events are exaggerated or transmogrified by the author--often with hilarious and irreverent results. The relentless pursuit of pleasure is constantly at odds with the pursuit of power. In one chapter entitled &quot;The Garden Of Computers&quot; Arenas brilliantly satirizes the bureaucracy of informants. &quot;...denunciations, backstabbings, and betrayals of friendship were the nourishment the machines lived on.&quot; This is as brilliant as anything Dickens ever wrote about corrupt institutions. Other authors that came to mind as I read &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; were Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, William Burroughs and, especially, Salman Rushdie. The amazing word-play in this book(in which 30 tongue twisters are interspersed)is delightful. Credit for this must surely be shared by the English translator Andrew Hurley. Sex(especially gay sex)is an obsession with most of the characters in this book-including the central tyrant Fifo(Castro). This is not a book for the timid or prudish. However, underneath it all there is a powerful affimation of the human spirit. Arenas expresses profound sadness, frustration, and anger--which cuts right through all the raucous humor. But, more than that, he imparts a sense of real joy through his characters' acts of defiance and creativity. I thoroughly recommend this book. A masterpiece.",2001-03-14,"Critics worldwide have praised Reinaldo Arenas's writing. His extraordinary memoir, Before Night Falls , was named one of the fourteen ""Best Books of 1993"" by the editors of The New York Times Book Review and has now been made into a major motion picture.The Color of Summer , Arenas's finest comic achievement, is also the fulfillment of his life's work, the Pentagonía , a five-volume cycle of novels he began writing in his early twenties. Although it is the penultimate installment in his ""secret history of Cuba,"" it was, in fact, the last book Arenas wrote before his death in 1990.

When the score is kept, there are winners and losers. Business is no different. The concept of open-book management has been around since some company owner in the distant past gathered employees and attempted to explain to them why it is so important to produce quality work, on time and without waste. No doubt at least one of those employees wondered ""What's in it for me?"" Good question.With contributions by Bo Burlingham, Stack wrote this book (first published in 1992) partly in response to that question. He introduces ""The Higher Laws of Business"":1. You get what you give.2. Its easy to stop one guy, but it's pretty hard to stop 100.3. What goes around comes around.4. You do what you gotta do.5. You gotta wanna.6. You can sometimes fool the fans, but you can never fool the players.7. When you raise the bottom, the top rises.8. When people set their own targets, they usually hit them.9. If nobody pays attention, people stop caring.10. As they say in Missouri: Shit rolls downhill. By which we mean change begins at the top.To these Stack adds ""The Ultimate Higher Law"": When you appeal to the highest level of thinking, you get the highest level of performance. These are the eleven laws on which Stack's system of open-book management is based. He explains each in thorough detail. Let's say that you agree that these laws make sense, that they are relevant to your own organization. Now what?Pretend that you have entered ""Stack's Open-Book Management Store."" He greets you at the door. For the next several hours, he guides you through an abundance of strategies, tactics, measurement instruments, communication devices, policies, procedures, etc. He answers all of your questions. He offers a number of caveats. He shares his own successes and failures. He directs you to the latest ""newer and better"" but also to ""what still works really well."" At the end of your visit, you are fully prepared to pick and choose from among all the options. Then he assists you with formulation of a plan to design and then implement your own open-book management program, one which is specifically appropriate to the needs of your own organization. In effect, this what happens as you read the book. I recommend it highly. Even if an open-book management program is not what your organization currently needs, the issues Stack addresses and the questions he raises are still worthy of your thoughtful consideration.",2000-05-02,"In the early 1980s, Springfield Remanufacturing  Corporation (SRC) in Springfield, Missouri, was a  near bankrupt division of International Harvester.  That's when a green young manager, Jack Stack,  took over and turned it around.

Wodehouse,10.85,41,229,1039,1806,1503,4618,408,0,4,"I dabbled in it to a certain extent, m'lord.","""Ring for Jeeves"" was first published in 1953 in the UK, though was first published in the US under the name ""The Return of Jeeves"". However, unusually for a Jeeves book, Bertie Wooster is absent. (The Second World War has been and gone, and the effects haven't been good for the aristocracy. The peasants are revolting, and many of the upper classes have actually had to start working for a living. Bertie's back at school, being taught how to fend for himself - just in case the proletariat become even more troublesome. Luckily, it's just a precaution, as his finances remain quite sound. In the meantime. Jeeves is on temporary assignment as the butler of Rowcester Abbey).However, it's a while before either Jeeves or his new employer - Bill Belfry, the ninth Earl of Rowcester - make an appearance. Instead, the book opens at the Goose and Gherkin, where Rosalinda ""Rosie"" Spottsworth is taking a break from her journey to the Abbey. Having out-lasted two exceptionally rich husbands, she's now exceptionally rich herself...and Bill's sister, Monica, has nearly convinced her to buy the stately home. (The pair had met in New York, though Bill hasn't quite been informed yet. However, he isn't remotely upset with the news - given that he is a member of the ""new"" aristocracy, he is very strapped for cash).Quite by chance, Rosie is soon joined by an old friend - Captain Biggar, the legendary big-game hunter. (Mr Spottsworth had been on a hunting expedition with the Captain when Rosie went from being Mrs Spottsworth to the Widow Spottsworth). Although more used to chasing down lions and rhinos, the Captain is again on the hunt - having backed an unlikely double at Epsom, he was due to collect about 3000 from his bookie. Unfortunately, the bookie in question - Honest Patch Perkins - and his clerk ran off without paying up. All the same, Biggar he knows he's on the right track - although his car has broken down, he's tailed them this far...and it's only a matter of time before he picks up the scent again. Unfortunately, Honest Patch Perkins is really a thinly-disguised (and totally broke) Bill...while his clerk was none other than Jeeves.Naturally, there are also major problems for the characters' romances. Biggar and the Widow Spottsworth have their sights set on one another, but the Great Hunter is being badly hampered by his code of honour. (He won't feel worthy of the Rosie until he has a fortune of his own...which makes him even more determined to get his hands on his winnings). In a typically Wodehousian twist, things are further complicated by Rosie's previous form with Bill - the pair had, briefly, taken moonlit strolls along the seafront in Cannes. (She was between husbands at the time). Poor Bill has to lay it on thick with Rosie, in an attempt to smooth the sale of the Abbey...which causes his fianc&eacute;e, Jill, no end of anguish and sparks waves of jealousy and contempt from Biggar. Jeeves' difficulties are compounded by Monica's husband, Rory Carmoyle - the sort of character you can rely on to say the worst possible thing, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, to the worst possible person.A little strange, for a Jeeves book - I'm used to Bertie telling the story, getting everything wrong and then being used as the book's fall guy. Jeeves plays a smaller role than normal too, though - luckily - his superior mental powers remain impressive. Still, an enjoyable and funny book overall...you can always rely on Plum.",2009-11-17,"A Jeeves novelCaptain Biggar, big-game hunter and all round tough guy, should make short work of the two bookies who have absconded with his winnings after a freak double made him a fortune.

In fact they're not bookies at all, but the impoverished Bill Belfry, Ninth Earl of Rowcester and his temporary butler, Jeeves.Bertie Wooster has gone away to a special school teaching the aristocracy to fend for itself 'in case the social revolution sets in with even greater severity'.

When a serial killer infiltrates the city, she starts losing sight of who she is and the secrets that she's held inside threaten to slip out. This also succeeds in alienating her husband, although she has no trouble in giving every ounce of her love to their little boy, Matthew.Her husband, Charlie, has no idea as to what's bothering his wife. He only knows that the recent murders have added to their troubles. He finds himself fretting over his wife's cold manner and her outright indifference, something that he's having trouble in accepting. This inadvertently throws him into the arms of a woman he'd never expected to have feelings for.As the murders continue, Mary Elizabeth starts questioning her sanity. She denies vehemently that she knows nothing in regards to why they're taking place. Yet deep inside, she also knows that's not true. She does know, but she's refused to deal with her traumatic past all this time.As the danger escalates, she and her husband are thrown in different directions. This, of course, is because of her own doing, but she chalks it down to the fact that she needs more space in order to make sense of her dark thoughts and feelings. Little does she know, time is running short.Driven to the edge of insanity, Mary Elizabeth takes things into her own hands. She wants only to make things right. To set the ghosts of her past to rest once and for all. Although she's pushed herself, and husband, to the point of no return, she knows that there's still hope. She, alone, has the power to make the killer go away. But only if she sets aside her doubts and insecurities. Only then will she able to see the light at the end of that dark tunnel.While this book may seem to have a bit of a slow start, don't let that fool you. It's one of those diamonds in the rough. I enjoyed reading this story and discovering what happens between Mary Elizabeth and her husband. The story is both bittersweet and heart-felt. I think we can all relate to the situations in which the characters find themselves.

Although she would later singlehandedly create a new approach to American cuisine with her cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking and her television show The French Chef, Julia Child was not always a master chef. Indeed, when she first arrived in France in 1948 with her husband, Paul, who was to work for the USIS, she spoke no French and knew nothing about the country itself. But as she dove into French culture, buying food at local markets and taking classes at the Cordon Bleu, her life changed forever with her newfound passion for cooking and teaching.

The narrator of Colour Of Memory, plus five or six close friends are all young, university-educated and living a near-impoverished existence in a series of barely inhabitable South London, Council flats.In Colour Of Memory, Dyer describes in beautifully vivid detail a series of intimate snapshots of life lived day to day on the margins of Thatcher's Britain in the mid-1980's. The novel begins with a kind of lost generation, Hemingway-esque line: &quot;In August it rained all the time-heavy, corrosive rain from which only nettles and rusty metal derived refreshment&quot;. From this line onward, the tone is set with the narrator losing his low-paying, unengaging, government-sponsored job as well as being evicted from his Brixton apatment. Narrator and friends are all portrayed by the author with a wistful, near-biographical approach. Discussing the Darwinist, capitalist landscape of Tory-dominated Britain, listening to Maria Callas on a cloudy afternoon, arguing the merits of John Coltrane's sixties-era recordings, smoking strong dope on the roof of the narrator's flat, attending parties in dangerous neighborhoods and just scraping by while trying to nurture their separate, artistic ambitions. Without question, the characters of Colour Of Memory, narrator included, are all 1980's beatniks of one kind or another and the novel makes clear how quixotic a life this really is- living in a society and an atmosphere that values financial prowess and ordinary survival skills over creativity of any variety.What takes place on the pages of Colour Of Memory is seemingly woven together with an invisible thread; there appears to be no obvious plot, rhyme or reason to the action. Yet, the reader is propelled forward through one shimmering vignette after another. One can't articulate why, one just seems to feel some connection to these people and therefore cares about what comes next, no matter the order of happenings. Colour Of Memory could be seen as self-indulgent and a tad mundane, but fortunately for the reader it easily escapes this fate by presenting itself as a compelling group of beautifully written recollections, sometimes sad, usually funny and certainly tracing the beginning of a great writer. Maybe Dyer summarized this novel before it even began with a quote from John Berger, probably his biggest influence: &quot; What remains of our hopes is a long despair which will engender them again&quot;.",2000-08-20,"'In the race to be first in describing the lost generation of the 1980s, Geoff Dyer in THE COLOUR OF MEMORY leads past the winning post. ""We're not lost"" one of his hero's friend's says, ""we're virtually extinct"". It is a small world in Brixton that Dyer commemorates, of council flat and instant wasteland, of living on the dole and the scrounge, of mugging, which is merely begging by force, and of listening to Callas and Coltrane. It is the nostalgia of the DHSS Bohemians, the children of unsocial security, in an urban landscape of debris and wreckage.

Instead of Roosevelt being re-elected for a third term Charles Lindbergh becomes president. Under Lindbergh's administration the US does not enter into World War 2 and in fact signs treaties with Hitler to remain nuetral during Hitlers quest to take over Europe. The ""nuetrality"" subtly begins to change the views of US citizens with anti-semitic sentiment seeming to predominant in the American public. A family that once felt safe as part of a country that was tolerant of differences now begins to fear for their safety.It's an interesting exploration of how subtle changes begin to make big impacts on a culture.

Anthony Kiedis is a vocalist of the world famous band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His life was full of so many exciting times like getting high and jumping off buildings into pools to playing in front of thousands of screaming fans. In this book AK recalls the many highs and lows of his life. There isn't a dull moment in this biography. From cover to cover I found it hard to put the book down. Any fan of the RHCP should read this book because it gives you a deeper understanding of what made them what they are today. The stories behind many of their songs are discussed. The many transformations that they went through are also detailed. Overall this book would be a great read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.,2007-03-27,"Now in paperback, the New York Times bestseller by one of rock's most provocative figures Scar Tissue is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir of a life spent in the fast lane. In 1983, four self-described ""knuckleheads"" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess.

I would be hesitant to do so. While the prose is beautiful and wording is breathtaking in places, it seems that the author spent more time on developing word choice than the story line. I found the first third of the book difficult to get into; it really moves a bit slow. The only thing that really kept me going was the rhythm of the language. The concept was intriguing enough, but it just lacked the power to carry the story for long.In order to understand the other issues I have with this novel, you must also know that I am a conservative Christian and live in a small, conservative community.With that said, I thought the sex scenes were a bit too graphic for a book classified for young adults. There wasn't much left to the imagination, from sweat to straddling to the soreness between her legs. If the book had been written for an adult audience, I would not have the same gripes. But a parent of a 14-year-old may want to steer away from this one.There was also some EXTREMELY explicit language. And, okay, I get that the characters developed through Mitch and his friends would probably not be polite and well-mannered, BUT I think it could be toned down a bit. I don't appreciate profanity on televison, and I don't appreciate it in literature, either.But my biggest complaint is that Christianity is yet again stereotyped as a hypocritical, ignorant, male-dominating religion. The father ""leads"" his family in prayer and then commits adultery on the side. He is adamant about his daughter being modest, and then he looks upon her with some sort of desire after realizing that she's had sex. It's sick. I am REALLY tired of the media and popular culture depicting Christians in this light. True Christians are nothing like the people who are often represented as such on television, and in this case, literature.In all, this is not an appropriate book for teens, and Christians are certainly NOT well-represented.",2007-08-01,"In the class of the high school English teacher she has been haunting, Helen feels them: for the first time in 130 years, human eyes are looking at her.

Her love of music saves her life and directs her to a path she would have never dreamed.A chance meeting with her music idol in a hotel sets the stage. Chance or destiny? As a reporter she is suppose to be focused and professional, instead she falls apart and is vunerable, some special spark in Eliza gets an never given interview from her idol and a new job. With a new job, a new city, a new place to live, a new roommate; a perfect fresh start. One would think. Her supervisor hates her, gives her mindless dribble pieces, her new apartment is a postage stamp, her new roommate is the male slut and the lead singer for the same band her brother is in.Her roommate...hum...Paul is artistically driven, emotional, passionate, a down with the pop culture dribble-thumbing the man-not in it for the fame musician-beautiful voice and raw undiluted talent. However, as noted above, a male slut that is NOT suppose to touch Eliza.The pull between two souls that have so much in common can sometimes be undeniable. However, that seemingly perfect connection between them is strained. The group lands a satanic record deal which is another way to squeeze the life out of Paul. A short band tour brings Eliza close with an undeniably sexy and sweet singer, Loring, as she writes a tour piece for work. Then everything falls apart.Eliza can't get over her fear of flying to travel with Paul and the Micheals on tour (yes all the other band members' names are Micheal). Will Paul jeopardize the entire bands future because he can't leave Eliza or can Eliza martyr herself to put the band first?Events that unfold are heartbreaking and frustrating. Lives can not be lived with peace; fear and pride can be as distructive as a bomb, and desperation can bring a person to do the unthinkable.Vague I understand, however, I can't give you more information as it could be detrimental to the process for you as the reader. I, as the reader, laughed, cried, was so very angry, and embarrasingly admit, loathed the person the recommended the book.

It refers to the New Directions edition of the play, now unfortunately out of print. The Dover edition does not have the delightful line drawings, nor the added essays on theatre by Jarry. Also, I don't much care for Dover's gratuitous (and inaccurate) translation of &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; as &quot;King Turd.&quot; On the other hand, as far as English translations go, Dover's is pretty much the only game in town.

One of the most extraordinary events of the late nineteenth century in Paris was the opening on December 11, 1896, at the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, of Alfred Jarry’s play Ubu Roi . The audience was scandalized by this revolutionary satire, developed from a schoolboy farce, which began with a four-letter word, defied all the traditions of the stage, and ridiculed the established values of bourgeois society. Barbara Wright’s witty translation of this riotous work is accompanied with drawings by Franciszka Themerson.

0674443020,The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution,Bernard Bailyn,26.06,99,226,796,1305,1714,4140,121,154,5,Fundamental,"When published in the 1960s, this book had a revolutionary effect on our understanding of the American Revolution. Its impact is undiminished by the passage of the last 40 years. Bailyn's scholarship and exposition remains as exciting as it must have been at the time of initial publication. Bailyn attempted to take a fresh look at the thinking of the individuals who made the Revolution. His work was based on an extensive survey and analysis of the large number of political pamphlets published in the years leading up to the revolution. His work benefited as well greatly from a number of other significant works of scholarship, such as Caroline Robbins' book on the Commonwealth tradition in 18th century thought. More than anything else, Bailyn succeeded in determining what key terms like 'power', 'liberty', and republicanism meant to the Revolutionary generations. In doing so, he was able to strip away anachronistic accretions from these terms and ideas and recover the actual thinking of the Revolutionaries and their opponents.Bailyn's achievement is manifold. He was able to show that dominant intellectual influence on the Revolutionaries was a compound of classical models, Common Law legal tradition, Enlightenment ideology, covenant theology, and a strong tradition of British intellectual and political dissent that had its roots in the Commonwealth period of the 17th century. The latter tradition was especially important and acted as the binding matrix for other traditions and interpretative lens through which other received ideas were focused. Bailyn shows how these ideas were articulated in the specifically American context and how they led inevitably to confrontation with the expanding imperial authority of Britain. This conflict led to new expansions of the basic ideology, some of which would represent completely novel ideas. The traditional ideas of representation and consent, constitutional basis of society, and sovereignty were overthrown and replaced to a very large extent by the concepts we still uphold.The development of these new ideas and the necessity to give them practical scope would lead to what Bailyn artfully termed &quot;The Contagion of Liberty&quot;; the expansion of concepts of rights and freedom well beyond the original categories of thought received by the Revolutionary generations. These would include attacks on slavery, the questioning of establishment of religion, speculation about democracy as a legitimate and potentially stable form of government, and an increasing emphasis on social equality generated from the realization of political equality. As Bailyn remarks, the thinking and writing on these topics provides the bridge between the world of the 18th century intellectuals and what would become the world of Madison and de Toqueville.Bailyn's analysis and scholarship are superb. The organization and quality of writing in this book are outstanding. Just as important, Bailyn is very good at supporting his analysis with well chosen excerpts from contemporary political pamphlets. His judicious choice of quotations not only serves to support his conclusions but gives a fine idea of the words and thoughts of the Revolutionaries and their opponents.This is a fundamental book for understanding the American past.",2002-01-04,"To the original text of what has become a classic of American historical literature, Bernard Bailyn adds a substantial essay, ""Fulfillment,"" as a Postscript. Here he discusses the intense, nation-wide debate on the ratification of the Constitution, stressing the continuities between that struggle over the foundations of the national government and the original principles of the Revolution.

What's worse, she doesn't even touch the real issues of the Caribbean. Not to mention, Jamaica Kincaid wrote the account as a longtime resident of the US. She doesn't even sound like a West Indian; she sounds like a pampered, naive North American who believes every nation that doesn't have a McDonald's on every block is third world, to exaggerate.

The book is a missive to the traveler, whether American or European, who wants to escape the banality and corruption of some large place.

If you do put forth the effort, I think you'll find that they engage the mind and that other thing, whatever it may be, that makes us what we call ""human."" Truly an outstanding collection.",2006-12-20,"In the stories that make up Oblivion, David Foster Wallace joins the rawest, most naked humanity with the infinite involutions of self-consciousness—a combination that is dazzlingly, uniquely his. These are worlds undreamt-of by any other mind. Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father's desperate loneliness by way of his son's daydreaming through a teacher's homicidal breakdown (""The Soul Is Not a Smithy""). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way (""The Suffering Channel""). Or capture the ache of love's breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring (""Oblivion""). Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate. Oblivion is an arresting and hilarious creation from a writer ""whose best work challenges and reinvents the art of fiction"" (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).Mister squishy --The soul is not a smithy --Incarnations of burned children --Another pioneer --Good old neon --Philosophy and the mirror of nature --Oblivion --The suffering channel",Back Bay Books,,,329,English,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1558611193,No Sweetness Here and Other Stories,Ketu H. Katrak,14.95,14,39,124,173,135,485,48,28,4,Tales depict Ghanaian life at onset of independence.,"A young man leaves his village in rural Ghana to look for hissister, Mansa,in the capital. The last time the family saw her wastwelve years ago when she was only ten. Arriving in Accra, the brother looks up Duayaw, a fellow villager, who was his sister's classmate in grade school. Duayaw thinks he's on a crazy mission. Where are they going to find her? Now at the age of twenty-two, she could even be married. The city-wise Duayaw actually suspects worse but being the polite host, he complies. &quot;In the Cutting of a Drink&quot; is one of eleven short stories in No Sweetness Here and Other Stories by Ama Ata Aidoo, a Ghanaian writer.Aidoo's novel, Changes, won the 1993 Commonwealth Writers Prize for the Africa region. No Sweetness Here was originally published in the United States by Doubleday in 1971. But it first appeared the previous year through Longman of Britain. The last Doubleday printing was in 1972. It was re-issued by the Feminist Press, the world's oldest continuing feminist publisher, which is primarily concerned with restoring important out-of-print historical and literary works by women.On the surface, &quot;In the Cutting of a Drink&quot; is a simple story. But a lot takes place. It demonstrates well the talent possessed by Aidoo who has also written poems and plays and served as Ghana's minister of education from 1982 to 1983. The story is narrated by Mansa's brother to his immediate family, other relatives, and some villagers. Aidoo cherishes the African oral tradition and in the tale the burden rests entirely with her narrating character. He must sustain his audience's attention and he succeeds. The result of his search is withheld till the end.His amazement of the city sounds exaggerated by today's standards but one has to keep in mind that Aidoo wrote the stories during the decade after Ghana's independence from Britain in 1957. To rural folk, Accra held novelty. &quot;Each time I tried to raise my eyes, I was dizzy from the number of cars which were passing,&quot; the narrator explains. At another point he describes his experience while walking along the streets at night with Duayaw: &quot;The whole place was as clear as the sky. Some of these lights are very beautiful indeed.&quot; Such descriptions, while captivating to the villagers, are nevertheless delivered in a tone that depicts the city as a crazy place.When No Sweetness Here was first published, there were already troubling political developments in Ghana. The country, which holds a unique place in the sub-Saharan region for being the first to gain independence, had a military coup in 1966. Its first civilian president, Kwame Nkrumah, the pan-Africanist and pioneering statesman, was toppled. Taken as a whole,these short stories therefore grapple with the social challenges of the first years of independent rule in the country.Ghanaians, like most Africans, were in between the end of colonial rule and a new nation in the making. Villagers arrived in the city in search of new opportunities. Young Africans--a small elite--returned from western universities and moved into the offices and residences vacated by the British. And corruption by the new public officials began to get noticed. In tackling these issues, Aidoo is a refreshing alternative in the African literary field which is dominated by men. One gets intriguing glimpses of Ghanaian women encountering everyday joys and tragedies.The short stories in the book are really a listening experience. One is either listening to a monologue or conversation depending on the number of narrators. The strength in Aidoo's emphasis on the oral skills of her characters is that they have a lot of room to be themselves. They pronounce words as some people actually do in Ghana. They say &quot;Klase Tri&quot; for &quot;Class Three,&quot; &quot;Chicha&quot; for &quot;Teacher,&quot; &quot;Kudiimin-o&quot; for &quot;Good evening&quot; and so on. For the unfamiliar reader, the stories can pose a challenge for one must scramble to learn and visualize the Ghanaian setting. The narrators often don't provide any background--they just start unfolding their tales.The book's afterword, written by Ketu H. Katrak, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is useful for it provides some context. Today, words and phrases like &quot;highlife,&quot; &quot;nation-building,&quot; and &quot;white man's land,&quot; which are used by Aidoo, sound slightly archaic though they were in vogue during the heady days of independence. Reading No Sweetness Here is to journey back to a period when Africa was supposed to make a fresh start, a period that now feels far away.",1998-01-20,"In this collection, Ama Aita Aidoo explores postcolonial life in Ghana with her characteristic honesty and humor. Tradition wrestles with new urban influences as Africans try to sort out their identity in a changing culture. True to the tradition of African storytelling, the characters come to life through their distinct voices and speech. If there is no sweetness, there is the salt essential to life, even if it comes from tears, and the strength that comes from a history of endurance.",The Feminist Press ,,['Ghana'],160,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The four stories in this collection are all fairly easy to follow, pretty straight-forward, good action/adventure with a touch of romance. The tedium of those fantasy authors who go to great detail to rename everything and come up with a gigantic cast of characters whose names you can never keep track of, and featuring wild creatures the average reader will have trouble imagining is blessedly missing here. Tamora keeps things much simpler with a handful of characters per story and her own spin on classic fantasy critters with only a few newcomers she describes rather well. The collection features a strong teenaged female lead who never actually feels that strong, who attempts to adjust to a new life, blossoming womanhood, and strange developing magical abilities simultaneously under the guidance of a mysterious sorcerer, the cunning King's Champion (also female), her animal friends, and a host of magical beings and gods. I would have given this book five stars, but I believe the author could use a little spit and polish on her writing style. There are several passages where things happen so quickly from the heroine's point of view, that the story jumps its track momentarily, making the reader have to go back and re-read the lines leading up to that point in order to better understand what's going on. There are also a few areas where the question of continuity comes into play. If Tamora would slow down a bit as she writes, perhaps taking the time to re-think scenarios during her rewrites, she could probably better describe a few scenes if she'd put herself in her characters' places and really imagine what's going on rather than let the writing muse sweep her along. The technical points are minor, yet noticeable, though her storylines overall are concise and just plain fun. The Immortals is enjoyable for adults as well as teens and even boys as well as girls. It's particularly good fun for anyone who loves nature and the things which populate it, and lovers of any good fantasy tales. Worth a read and a re-read later on!

It is stumpy, mishapen, and can be as big as a giant or a small as a dwarf. It has been known to abduct children. Trolls have made appearances in such literary works as BEOWULF, LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER. With that in mind, you should be prepared for the unexpected in this novel by the Finnish author Johanna Sinisalo. You will not be disappointed. This writer has crafted a bizarre but strangely moving love story between Mikael, nicknamed Angel, a young Finnish photographer, and a troll whom he rescues from a pack of hoodlums one midnight as the young man staggers home from a night of drinking and unrequited lust for one Martes, who says he is only looking for &quot;good conversation.&quot; Angel takes the troll in, nurses him back to health and starts down a path from which there is no return. With each passing day, Angel finds himself becoming more hopelessly attached to the troll with the juniper-berry smell-- whom he names Pessi-- and having to hide his new housemate from his friends and neighbors. As you would expect, a novel about a love affair between a man and a troll will not have a happy ending. Even so, I was not quite ready for the explosive finale.Ms. Sinisalo's prose is both concise and evocative: &quot;I look him [Martes] in the eyes. His face wears a friendly, open, and understanding smile. He seems at once infinitely lovable and completely unknown. His eyes are computer icons, expressionless diagrams, with infinite wonders behind them, but only for the elect, those able to log on.&quot; The author raises questions about man's relationship with wild creatures-- how much we know or don't know about them and what they know about us. She seems to say something about the animalistic tendences that lie deeply hidden in the most civilized of us just waiting to be let loose.Although on one level, TROLL is just a great story that you cannot stop reading, on another it asks questions about the very nature of us all.",2004-05-15,"Everyone has their rough nights, but things have clearly taken a turn for the surreal when Angel, a young photographer, finds a group of drunken teenagers in the courtyard of his apartment building, taunting a young troll. Trolls are known in Scandinavian mythology as wild beasts like the werewolf, but this troll is just a small, wounded creature. Angel decides to offer it a safe haven for the night. In the morning Angel thinks he dreamed it all. But he finds the troll alive, well, and drinking from his toilet. What does one do with a troll in the city?Angel begins researching frantically. Angel searches the Internet, folklore, nature journals, and newspaper clippings, but his research doesn't tell him that trolls exude pheromones that have a profound aphrodisiac effect on all those around him. As Angel's life changes beyond recognition, it becomes clear that the troll is familiar with the man's most forbidden feelings, and that it may take him across lines he never thought he'd cross. A novel of sparkling originality, Troll is a wry, peculiar, and beguiling story of nature and man's relationship to wild things, and of the dark power of the wildness in ourselves.",Grove Press,"['Martes', 'Enkeli', 'Palomita', 'Tohtori Spiderman', 'Ecke', 'Pessi']",,278,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I in turn had quibbles with some of the characters. Richard as has been commented on, but also Odenigbo who, for a key character, I found a little too much of a foil for the story. Much of the conflict and contradictions we glimpse of him seems contrived and merely functional in moving the story along or providing grist to develop a more textured Olanna on. Perhaps this is because we do not get to explore this character sufficiently and he thus compares unfavorably in complexity.That said, this is a story that has etched these characters in my mind and many parts of their narrative resonated deeply with mine. And that to me is what a great novel is about. Being Nigerian. this story and its context is also of some personal significance.For those who, having read the novel, are interested in a 45 minute BBC rehash of Biafra and that time in Nigerian history, I found a link to a BBC documentary on YouTube that may be a starting point. Search for Biafra in case Amazon shreds the link I added here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ReFoFp0Gs&feature;=related).",2008-02-20,"A masterly, haunting new novel from a writer heralded by The Washington Post Book World as “the 21st-century daughter of Chinua Achebe,” Half of a Yellow Sun re-creates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra’s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in Nigeria in the 1960s, and the chilling violence that followed. With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor’s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna’s twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race—and the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place, bringing us one of the most powerful, dramatic, and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had.",Knopf,"['Ugwu', 'Olanna', 'Kainene', 'Odenigbo', 'Richard']","['Umuahia', 'West Africa', 'Kano', 'Lagos', 'Africa', 'Port Harcourt', 'Abba, Imo', 'Nigeria', 'Orlu', 'Nsukka', 'Biafra']",433,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In outward form, number9dream is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister’s death and his mother’s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses—through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck—a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father’s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.",Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['Buntaro Ogiso', 'Ai Imajo', 'Eiji Miyake', 'Yuzu Daimon']",['Tokyo'],401,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the poetry and other materials are very good, but I could have done without the eco-politics beyond a certain point, and its lack of recognition of the political issues in the Celtic nations was a significant failure.

Narrator Buster Fogg's family is wiped out by a twister in an early sequence described with surreal verve. Buster hitches on with Billy Bob Daniels, a patent-medicine pusher and trick shooter who claims to be the illegitimate son of Wild Bill Hickock, joining an entourage consisting of a kindly ex-slave named Albert, and Rot Toe, the wrestling ape. Adventures on the road, which include swiping the mummified remains of Billy Bob's ""pa"" and swindling settlers with their concoction of watered-down whiskey, stoke personal tensions that only aggravate troubles when their wagon rolls into Mud Creek and Billy Bob is called out by Texas Jack, a dime-novel desperado who, legend says, intimidated even Wild Bill.Lansdale's affection for the classic western is never in doubt, although he spends much of the novel skillfully deflating the romance of heroic reputations made as much by luck and exaggeration as by skill with a gun. The true charm of the story, though, is in its telling, which melds laconic humor, colorful colloquialisms and outrageous figures of speech into a Twainesque tall tale.

In his second Pulitzer Prize-winner, The Piano Lesson, Wilson has fashioned his most haunting and dramatic work yet. At the heart of his play stands the ornately carved upright piano which, as the Charles family's prized, hard-won possession, has been gathering dust in the parlor of Berniece Charles's Pittsburgh home. When Boy Willie, Berniece's exuberant brother, bursts into her life with his dream of buying the same Mississippi land that his family had worked as slaves, he plans to sell their antique piano for the hard cash he needs to stake his future. But Berniece refuses to sell, clinging to the piano as a reminder of the history that is their family legacy.

I found this an incredible thing to do, because I was faced with the genius that was Poe. Most of us know that he was the father of the short story genre, and that many famous authors (not the least of which were Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie) tried to follow in his footsteps. This is an almost impossible task because the genius of Poe was his poet's nature which allowed him to write very beautiful prose too. He also had the gift of mixing his impalpable shadows of mystery which run through all his tales with an almost obsessive attention to detail. This brought his stories to life when he wrote them, and this power still brings them to life today. It is difficult to pick a favourite tale out of so many gems, but I'd have to go with ""The Black Cat"", I think. In this tale Poe's protagonist allows a very intimate glimpse of the darkest recesses of his souls, and we descend into madness with him.

It is the spring of 1968 in Belfast and James Kirkpatrick has just lost his father under suspicious circumstances, Casey Riordan is released from prison after five years and Pamela O'Flaherty has crossed an ocean and a lifetime of memories to find the man she fell in love with as a little girl. All three lives are on a collision course with each other against the backdrop of the burgeoning civil rights movement and a nation on the brink of revolution. They come from disparate backgrounds-Jamie a wealthy aristocrat whose life is like an imperfect but multi-faceted jewel-brilliant, flawed and with a glitter that is designed to distract the observer. Casey, a card-carrying member of the Irish Republican Army, who must face the fact that five years away has left him a stranger, a misfit in his own neighborhood where not everyone is sympathetic to a convicted rebel. Pamela, who has come to Ireland in search of a memory and a man who may not have existed in the first place. Through it all runs the ribbon of a love story: love of country, the beginning love of two people unable to resist the pull of each other regardless of the cost to themselves and those around them, and the selfless love of one man who no longer believes himself capable of such emotion.

Alike only in their courage, they forge a bond of friendship in battle with far-reaching consequences for themselves, and for the future of those they love.",Ballantine Books,,"['Norfolk, England']",384,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

ThereWas nobody else around, the other cottages wereDark, as was mine. He kept walking straight outAnd soon the water was over his head. I shout-Ed but he obviously didn't hear. He was tryingTo drown himself! So I swam out and grabbed him. Sighing,I resuscitated him. He lay on our bedSmiling. Thanks a lot but no thanks, he said.Then he convinced me that no matter what I didHe was going to commit suicide.I had an idea: Does it make any difference howYou do it? I asked him. No, he replied,What do you mean. Well, what about the electricI WANT MY FRIENDS IN WOODY LOTS,WITH FRENCH TOAST UP THEIR NOSTRILSChair? Would you care if it was that? No,He said.

Send the ten grand to N, who rejected me. She'llFeel sorrier then when I'm dead. He grinned. ISaid, Great. The next night I slippedMy wife 2 sleeping-pills then drove to my brother'sTo try to establish an alibi but he got drunk,Passed out so that was no go--damn.When I got home I went right to my wife's room whereI found her snoring. What the hell, I said. ThenThe phone rang. It was my brother,He said someone had murdered our father. Father!I said. A hectic day followed. Police, the taxLawyers, not to mention, my worthless alibi.Finally that night I sat up late waiting for the guyOCTOBERWho was supposed to murder my wife. The phone rang. MyBrother had been killed! I was chief suspectSince I inherited the family millions. Wake up, wake up,I shook my wife, but the 3 sleeping-pills etcetera.The police followed me all the next dayBut I slipped them. They didn't know I was hitting all thejointsTo try and find that young drown man.

When they foundMy body the coroner ruled suicide over remorse at my terriblecrimes.He had done the murders but I got the blame.My wife got all the money, and married him.It's a continuing source of gladness and wonder to me that one literary craftsman can celebrate and extend the work of another in this way.

A relentless failure, Nelson has botched nearly every scheme he's attempted to pull off. Now his future lies in a potentially profitable marijuana patch hidden in the lush old-growth redwoods on the family land.Nelson has some serious problems. His marriage has fallen apart, and he may lose his land, cash and crop in the divorce. What's more, in need of some quick cash, he had foolishly agreed to smuggle $90,000 worth of cocaine through customs for Harry Lally, a major player in a drug syndicate. Chickening out just before bringing the drugs through, he flushed the powder. Now Lally wants him dead, and two goons are hot on his trail.

It is narrated from third person, and every chapter is devoted to the events around one of the main characters (which get interwoven towards the end): psychologically deep autocrat Hasan Ibn Sabbah, idealistic intelligent young ""apprentice"" Ibn Tahir, or beautiful Miriam, clever and emotional woman in Hasan's harem.Hasan is a cunning ruler of a sect in a distanced castle, plotting to gain wider authority against other rulers through use of fanatic assassins. Ibn Tahir is a young apprentice in a school devoted to training fedai - suicidal assassins, but too smart to take it easily. Miriam is gorgeous harem organizer, supposed to pretend herself and other girls to be virgins in eternal paradise, as a reward for all fedai that would die for ""the cause"".Hasan's plan gets off with all imaginable problems - from love, treason, faith, doubt, to all kinds of logistical problems of warfare. The plot's entanglement is resembling the classical drama. Simple starting positions, long, interesting complications with a nerve-wrecking climax, and then very short but philosophically concentrated ending of dialogues and thoughts.Characters are developed through action, through personal reflection and through narration. Development is very readable and plausible. Descriptions of the environment and social norms of those times are coherent and plausible - writer did his homework.The missing star is due to inaccurate use of philosophical thought in the ending discussions of many characters, particularly of Hasan ibn Sabbah. Dialogues too closely mimic the classical philosophers, and there is Plato, saint Augustine, Machiavelli, Kant and Nietzsche all over the place. That however might be positive for many readers, as the book is much more readable than original works of mentioned philosophers. It was also unnatural to me that Ibn Tahir would be equivalent interlocutor to Hasan by depth of thought despite all the experience he gained.In the end I also missed a clearer (moral) interpretation of the actions of various characters, depending on the amount of pages for their reflections - but that is just the way it is many times - with actions of simple people and powerful rulers.-----------I am a Slovenian, and would like to clear some misunderstandings (sadly, I have not read the book in english version).1. Book was always meant as fiction, based only loosely on historic events, and motivated much more by the rise of nihilism percieved by the author at that time. Bartol was quite influenced by Nietzsche's writings. First page of the book says ""nothing is real, everything is allowed"" - that is the author's greatest concern and that's what this book is about.2. Bartol is not Vergil or Sapfo when creating poems in his own language either :-). But - why expect from a young assassin apprentice to be one...3. This was never one of Slovenian Classics - it got its appraisal and recognition very late, and it really took off only after 9/11 events. Slovenian ""soul"" regarding literary works was not influenced by Bartol, and in my judgement wrongfully so. I can only hope it would be from now on. As to the reasons why, it is as always - politics. An I leave it there.-------The book was selected for reading in literature part of state-wide final exam for high schools, two or three years after 9/11 events. I read it out of curiosity whether it was selected only because of world-wide hype with suicidal assassins, since it was unknown to me before. I found it to be a great book, readable more than once as one grows in understanding of his own beliefs and in understanding cultural differences of the world, past and present.I hope that clears up usual discrepancies and shows my own biases (writing too long posts, for one).",2012-12-26,"Alamut takes place in 11th Century Persia, in the fortress of Alamut, where self-proclaimed prophet Hasan ibn Sabbah is setting up his mad but brilliant plan to rule the region with a handful elite fighters who are to become his ""living daggers."" By creating a virtual paradise at Alamut, filled with beautiful women, lush gardens, wine and hashish, Sabbah is able to convince his young fighters that they can reach paradise if they follow his commands.Alamut tells the story of how Sabbah was able to instill fear into the ruling class by creating a small army of devotees who were willing to kill, and be killed, in order to achieve paradise. Believing in the supreme Ismaili motto “Nothing is true, everything is permitted,” Sabbah wanted to “experiment” with how far he could manipulate religious devotion for his own political gain through appealing to what he called the stupidity and gullibility of people and their passion for pleasure and selfish desires. The novel focuses on Sabbah as he unveils his plan to his inner circle, and on two of his young followers — the beautiful slave girl Halima, who has come to Alamut to join Sabbah's paradise on earth, and young ibn Tahir, Sabbah's most gifted fighter. As both Halima and ibn Tahir become disillusioned with Sabbah's vision, their lives take unexpected turns. Alamut was originally written in 1938 as an allegory to Mussolini's fascist state. In the 1960's it became a cult favorite throughout Tito's Yugoslavia, and in the 1990s, during the Balkan's War, it was read as an allegory of the region's strife and became a bestseller in Germany, France and Spain.",Scala House Press,"['Halima', 'Avani ibn Tahir', 'Hassan-i Sabbāh']","['Persia', 'Alamut (Iran)', 'Middle East', 'Iran']",510,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He has conducted extensive interviews with Che's comarades-some of whom speak here for the first time-and with CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara's body was buried, which led to the exhumation and stat burial of the bones.

Kuhn does the same: saying that prevailing views of science change from time to time, then coming up with some blatant kablooie that explains it in accordance with his particular worldview. He pays no attention to the fact that science is a search for the truths of nature, not a search for fresh paradigms, and that paradigms only shift when there's reasonable evidence that theories are moving closer to the truth. A bad book based on the wrong premise.",1999-06-23,"A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context.  Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.",University of Chicago Press,,,226,English,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rarefied and raw dream and after-death encounters and conflicts, with unforgettable characters in a multitude of hilarious satiric black humor routines, will stab you in the ribs with a poisoned quill. Not for the squeamish, dogmatic or uninformed. &iexcl;novel biological mutations! Step right up. William S. Burroughs' examination of the function of the author is so candid and deeply moving that its authenticity can't be denied. The poems, ""Breathe in your death"" and ""I WORK FOR THE BLACK HOLE,..."" are, respectively, an exquisite cut-up and an informed, funny post-scientific verse. Who can award a Commander of Arts and Letters of this caliber less than 5 stars?Like to offer a few simple pointers to help in navigating through this most accomplished and inspired of Burroughs' works. Starting with the title ""The Western Lands,"" which in ancient Egyptian would read ""Amenta,"" referring to the land of the dead who, by tradition, were always entombed to the west of Egypt. In present time, the most potent power accumulation is concentrated in the West. Suddenly you might recognize Western Culture as overwhelmed by material wealth, wielding the technology for total dominance/destruction, but metaphysically only ""minutes away"" from total bankruptcy. Burroughs wastes no words over this formula: spiritual bankruptcy = death. Species disappearing from the planet faster than the rising national debts.Most important to understand, ladies and gentlemen, the possibility of much of his fiction as factual analogs. He delineates the 7 souls, Hollywood style, with deadly humor. The existence of Immortality isn't just the question of an eccentric old man. It's a question all civilizations face, and there's nothing frivolous about it when a dying culture sees it has no answers. Naturally, (profiting from the course of collapse) Nazis, Mafias, CIA, KGB and other boards and syndicates all have walk-on parts. All all all only to be topped and toppled by the inexorable expansion of the white light of Margaras (Skt.). The cat Margaras is the agent of total awareness and observation. Break this book open at any page and be amazed.",2002-05-08,"The Western Lands is the eagerly awaited new novel by the most visionary American novelist of the twentieth century–a haunting Book of the Dead for the nuclear age.Every new work from the pen of William S.

For in this novel, Burroughs completes a trilogy that began with Cities of the Red Night and The Place of Dead Roads, with a profound, revealing, and often astounding meditation on the themes of mortality, loneliness, nuclear peril–and the inextinguishable hope for an existence beyond bodily death.The symbolic vehicle Burroughs uses here is ancient Egyptian mythology, a long-standing interest of his. ""The Western Lands"" of the title are the territory to which the Egyptians believed the souls of the dead made a hazardous pilgrimage in their quest for true immortality. The questers–Joe the Dead, Kim Carsons, the scribe Neferti, Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain–travel through an unmistakably Burroughs-esque universe of appalling danger and otherworldly beauty–now the back alleys of ancient Egypt, now bombed-out Berlin, now the Old West of the shootists. Their hallucinatory journeys express the author's belief that only through facing the most extreme dangers and testing the possibilities of biological mutation can man escape a dead-end world of blasted dreams and atomic finale. And presiding over all is the haunting figure of ""the old writer,"" who shares in the fate of his characters in being finally unable to write himself out of Time, and into Space.The Western Lands continues and extends one of the great literary odysseys of our time, adding to Burroughs's awesome literary style and black humor chilling touches of elegy and autobiography. It is at once Burroughs's most personal and most universal work, yet another masterwork from the reigning genius of the American literary avant-garde.",Penguin Books,,,258,English,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Amazingly, he completed the task in an intense six weeks, and Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser was published in Vienna to immediate success, and is now available in seventeen languages across the world. Toward the end of his long life, Gombrich embarked upon a revision and, at last, an English translation. A Little History of the World presents his lively and involving history to English-language readers for the first time. Superbly designed and freshly illustrated, this is a book to be savored and collected. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colorful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science. This is a text dominated not by dates and facts, but by the sweep of mankind's experience across the centuries, a guide to humanity's achievements and an acute witness to its frailties.

Over the years people have come to criticize the author, John Neidhardt. The book ends somewhat abruptly not long after Wounded Knee and then there is an account of Black Elk's prayer on Harney Peak when he was an old man and he asked to make his people live again. Many seem to feel Neidhardt was exploiting Black Elk to get a book out of him. I don't claim to be an expert on Black Elk and this subject, but from what I know I do not agree with this. Black Elk had been off the reservation as a young man in the Buffalo Bill Show and given his experiences he was hardly naive or ignorant. Black Elk's son Ben had been in the Carlyle school so he would have known if the book did not reflect his father's vision and words and life. The book was also not an instant bestseller. Neidhardt promoted this book and Black Elk's vision tirelessly until the end of his life and I truly believe it was because he saw the incredible spiritual nature of Black Elk, his life, and visions. And his ""great vision"" as a youngster can only be described as cataclysmic and psychedelic. When the spirits want you to see something, you will see it and no drugs are necessary.Neidhardt left out the ensuing years on Pine Ridge Reservation and Black Elk's acceptance of Catholicism to frame a lost way of life, the sadness and injustice of it, and the greatness and seeming inevitability of Black Elk's vision. I believe any poetic license taken was actually rather minute and in service of bringing forth a greater truth. Those who want to pick at the book miss the greater impact of Black Elk's life and vision.Some feel Black Elk became a Catholic as a way of continuing to also be able to teach the Lakota way along with the Christian faith to preserve the Lakota culture. I believe he was intelligent and had such a great spirit he saw he could blend both faiths and build a bridge for the future. Nor was he intimidated into the Christian faith. His daughter said his acceptance of the Catholic faith was true and not a sham to keep teaching the Lakota ways surreptitiously. If Black Elk interests you there are books available on the later half of his life. Black Elk lived until 1950.",2011-08-16,"""Black Elk Speaks,"" the story of the Oglala Lakota visionary and healer Nicholas Black Elk (1863-1950) and his people during momentous twilight years of the nineteenth century, offers readers much more than a precious glimpse of a vanished time. Black Elk's searing visions of the unity of humanity and Earth, conveyed by John G. Neihardt, have made this book a classic that crosses multiple genres. Whether appreciated as the poignant tale of a Lakota life, as a history of a Native nation, or as an enduring spiritual testament, Black Elk Speaks is unforgettable.Black Elk met the distinguished poet, writer, and critic John G. Neihardt in 1930 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and asked Neihardt to share his story with the world. Neihardt understood and conveyed Black Elk's experiences in this powerful and inspirational message for all humankind.",Bison Books,,,270,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

For anyone who knows him only as the author of the Willy Wonka books--or who thinks of him purely as a children's book author--this is the book to change your mind and make you think admiringly about Dahl's considerable powers as an adult writer.The book is comprised of gem after gem. Two of Dahl's most famous stories are here. One is ""Lamb to the Slaughter,"" about the wife of a police detective who kills her husband in a most unconventional way and then disposes of the murder weapon in a manner that would make any criminal proud. The other, ""Nunc Dimittis,"" describes the lengths to which a society smoothie goes for revenge.Dahl's descriptive powers are basic, but his imagination is limitless. He manages to calmly, smoothly pull you into his stories and make the most outrageous things seem perfectly in keeping and perfectly normal--while still just a bit askew.The stories are all vintage Dahl. Each has elements of the macabre and the grotesque, couched in the comfortable trappings of middle-class life: marriage, tidy houses, bills, resentment, secrets, tidy houses, and so on. Dahl pulls off the neat trick of making the macabre laughable, though--he's not trying to scare the reader as much as make us shout with laughter and recognition and then settle back to enjoy a shiver of anticipation. In ""William and Mary,"" the terminally ill narrator is propositioned by a neurosurgeon friend to give his brain up for experimentation after death. Despite the gruesome details, the story is hilarious:"" . . . So when I get you on the table I will take a saw, a small oscillating saw, and with this I shall proceed to remove the whole vault of your skull. You'd still be unconscious at that point so I wouldn't have to bother with anaesthetic.""""Like hell you wouldn't,"" I said.""You'd be out cold, I promise you that, William. Don't forget you DIED just a few minutes before.""""Nobody's sawing off the top of my skull without an anaesthetic,"" I said.Dahl doesn't get any better than this!",2002-03-17,"A wine connoisseur with an infallible palate and a sinister taste in wagers.

Social climbers who climb a bit too quickly. Philanderers whose deceptions are a trifle too ornate. Impeccable servants whose bland masks slip for one vertiginous instant.In these deliciously nasty stories an internationally acclaimed practitioner of the short narrative works his own brand of black magic: tantalizing, amusing, and sometimes terrifying readers into a new sense of what lurks beneath the ordinary.

Its modern story focuses on Silver, born in 1959, ""part precious metal, part pirate."" A young girl without a father, Silver is orphaned at ten and moves into the local lighthouse with Pew, the aged and blind lighthousekeeper, whose family has tended the light in northwest Scotland since 1828. There, she polishes the brasswork, makes the tea, and listens to Pew's stories, some of them historical and some more fanciful, but all of them filled with wisdom and lessons from the past.The lighthouse, we learn through Pew's stories, was built by the father of Robert Louis Stevenson. In 1878, R. L. Stevenson comes to the lighthouse for a visit and is fascinated by the story of Babel Dark, a local preacher, who becomes the inspiration for Mr. Hyde in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dark, we learn through stories, falls in love with beautiful Molly in the early 1850s, then sees her embracing another man, becomes overcome with jealousy, and rejects her. Taking the symbolic name of Lux (meaning ""light"") when he is with Molly, Dark is unable to control his emotions and becomes a Hyde-like abuser. ""He was dark...the light in him never lit.""As the stories of Silver (which reflects light) and Babel Dark develop in tandem, the novel takes on operatic qualities, with the two stories often sounding like duets, one voice light and one dark, singing in counterpoint to each other. As each person seeks fulfillment through love and connection, the cadence of Winterson's writing rises and falls, swirls, and turns in upon itself, with the same themes of creation, connection, and the continuity of life echoing throughout. Winterson's incorporation of the Tristan and Isolde story, along with the visit of Charles Darwin to the lighthouse, expands and further emphasizes the themes.Both romantic and philosophical, Winterson offers much unique imagery. Pew, for example, is a ""silent, taciturn clamp of a man."" An Albanian family was ""vacuum-packed into a ship,"" the grandmother, ""all sun-dried tomato, tough, chewy, skin split with the heat."" Her narrative tempo is flawless, the language elegant, and the characterization consistent with the themes. The end of the book harks back to the beginning, completing a circle and granting new insights into her meanings. A rich novel which the reader will want to read slowly and savor.

I was born part precious metal, part pirate.""), an orphaned girl who is taken in by blind Mr. Pew, the mysterious and miraculously old keeper of a lighthouse on the Scottish coast. Pew tells Silver stories of Babel Dark, a nineteenth-century clergyman. Dark lived two lives: a public one mired in darkness and deceit and a private one bathed in the light of passionate love. For Silver, Dark's life becomes a map through her own darkness, into her own story, and, finally, into love.One of the most original and extraordinary writers of her generation, Jeanette Winterson has created a modern fable about the transformative power of storytelling.",Mariner Books,,,232,English,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I bought it because of the blips comparing it to ""Confederacy of Dunces"" (which is absurd) and also because it does have a pretty interesting ""this looks to be entertaining"" premise.However, it was a frustrating one to get through. A few reasons: the main character is impossible to like (he spends most of the time whining...it gets old), most of the other characters are equally annoying and stereotypical, the wannabe-witty dialogue is anything but, and, worst of all, you just can't shake the notion that it could be pretty good.",2004-09-03,"Jules Duchon was a real New Orleans vampire. Born and bred in the working-class Ninth Ward, bitten and smitten with the Big Easy. Driving through the French Quarter, stuck in a row of bumper-to-bumper cars that crept along Decatur Street like a caravan of bone-weary camels, Jules Duchon barely fit behind the steering wheel of his very big Cadillac taxicab. Even with the seat pushed all the way back.Damn, he was hungry.Jules stopped his cab, pressed the wobbly rocker switch that jerked the electric windows reluctantly to life, and stuck his head into the humid night air. “Hey, baby. You interested in some dinner?”–from Fat White Vampire Blues
  
Vampire, nosferatu, creature of the night–whatever you call him–Jules Duchon has lived (so to speak) in New Orleans far longer than there have been drunk coeds on Bourbon Street. Weighing in at a whopping four hundred and fifty pounds, swelled up on the sweet, rich blood of people who consume the fattiest diet in the world, Jules is thankful he can’t see his reflection in a mirror. When he turns into a bat, he can’t get his big ol’ butt off the ground. What’s worse, after more than a century of being undead, he’s watched his neighborhood truly go to hell–and now, a new vampire is looking to drive him out altogether. See, Jules had always been an equal opportunity kind of vampire. And while he would admit that the blood of a black woman is sweeter than the blood of a white man, Jules never drank more than his fair share of either. Enter Malice X . Young, cocky, and black, Malice warns Jules that his days of feasting on sisters and brothers are over. He tells Jules he’d better confine himself to white victims–or else face the consequences. And then, just to prove he isn’t kidding, Malice burns Jules’s house to the ground. With the help of Maureen, the morbidly obese, stripper-vampire who made him, and Doodlebug, an undead cross-dresser who (literally) flies in from the coast– Jules must find a way to contend with the hurdles that life throws at him . . . without getting a stake through the heart.
